I write a lot of documentation at my day job so I figured it would make sense to start putting some of that over here on Github for future reference and maybe it will help somebody else.

Since I am writing these for internal documentation for my company, I will have to make edits to certain things when bringing them over to Github, and many of the references I make will be internally focused and may not be applicable in other environments.

Generally and broadly speaking, the docs should hopefully be helpful anywhere given the concepts and topics covered.
