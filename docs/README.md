I write a lot of documentation at my day job so I figured it would make sense to start putting some of that over here on Github for future reference and maybe it will help somebody else.

Since I am writing these for internal documentation for my company, I will have to make edits to certain things when bringing them over to Github, and many of the references I make will be internally focused and may not be applicable in other environments.

Generally and broadly speaking, the docs should hopefully be helpful anywhere given the concepts and topics covered.

misc.

today I found [Jeffrey Snover's blog](https://www.jsnover.com/blog/2013/12/07/write-host-considered-harmful/) and I was thinking to myself "Wow this guy really knows a lot about Powershell" and then I went to the "About" page and this guy INVENTED Powershell. Wow what a doozy. anyway now I'm going to have to be mindful of everything I ever write using write-host, this is probably what's breaking a lot of my intune remediations lol. Something to keep in mind!
