# tweak the number of Write-Host and Scramble-String's you need to fit your .csv you're generating
# this makes it simple to grab a huge list of random passwords and plop them into your .csv
# the .csv has to be formatted like: samaccountname,randompassword 
# the .csv has to be named: pws.csv | and saved in same local directory script is running from -- its hardcoded in set-pw.ps1 script for reasons
