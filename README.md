# it-tools

- a collection of things i've worked on at various companies
- i typically work with Microsoft (Entra / Intune / Azure) stack in a system administrator (or sometimes even cloud architect if they're feeling fancy) role wherever i am at, so that's the role(s) these tools are tailored for
- some tools may be very specific to whichever environment i was working at when i made it, some may be more generally useful
- every environment i have ever been at so far has been HAADJ so if you're a Windows admin you're already groaning just reading that, this repo therefore has a ton of weird wonky stuff to clobber on-prem stuff together for use with cloud stuff
- you can in fact build an entire career out of helping orgs transition from HAADJ to AADJ!
