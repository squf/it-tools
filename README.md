# about

- a collection of things i've worked on at various companies
- i typically work with Microsoft (Entra / Intune / Azure) in a system administrator role wherever i am at, so that's the role(s) these tools are tailored for
- this means i deal with anything and everything in a jack-of-all-trades generalist role 
- some tools may be very specific to whichever environment i was working at when i made it, some may be more generally useful
- **every environment i have ever been at has been HAADJ** so if you're a Windows admin you're already groaning, this repo therefore has a ton of weird wonky stuff to clobber on-prem stuff together for use with cloud stuff
- you can build an entire career out of helping orgs transition from HAADJ to AADJ 🎉

# docs

- i recently added a docs repo here to store documentation on a wide variety of topics i encounter

- [Rudy Ooms' blog](https://call4cloud.nl/) - Rudy is extremely prolific in his writing and extensively details how Intune really works behind the scenes
- [PatchMyPC blog](https://patchmypc.com/blog/) - more posts by Rudy here and the PatchMyPC team, a good blog even if you don't use PMPC
- [T-Bones' blog](https://www.tbone.se/) - a very helpful blog and where i started learning to use Azure runbooks from
- [WinAdmins blog & Discord](https://winadmins.io/) - very useful resources here, and having an active Discord full of fellow Windows Admins is 👌
- [Jeffrey Snover's blog](https://www.jsnover.com/blog/) - invented Powershell ⚠️ not frequently updated and mostly abandoned but some good old info on here
- [boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev/) - a great place to learn backend engineering concepts and languages, a little on the pricy side but i think its worth it

# future goals

- **learning C# via gamedev**, beefing up my developer skills - Unity, MonoGame, FNA, .NET - I like C# a lot, it directly helps me with future Azure stuff -> [check out more here](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/features/azure/)
- **boot.dev and gaining better "devops" / "backend engineer" skills** - Golang, Python, Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform, Git, etc. - these topics are all DIRECTLY related to my current goals of "doing what i am currently doing, but better"
- **MS Certs?** - maybe, on the one hand i don't think certs are valuable for career advancement, and almost no job has ever asked me about a cert -- but on the other hand, they are pretty handy little self-contained goals with clear learning paths. I have an AZ-900 already, the entry level one, but maybe like an MS-102 and then work up to the bigger expert level ones? I'd think my big goal with this if I was going to go after more certs would be to go for the AZ-305. if i git gud at C# then there's Azure developer certs too like az-204, or devops ones specifically like az-400.
