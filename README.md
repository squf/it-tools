# about

- a collection of things i've worked on at various companies
- i typically work with Microsoft (Entra / Intune / Azure) in a system administrator role wherever i am at, so that's the role(s) these tools are tailored for
- this means i deal with anything and everything in a jack-of-all-trades generalist role 
- some tools may be very specific to whichever environment i was working at when i made it, some may be more generally useful
- **every environment i have ever been at has been HAADJ** so if you're a Windows admin you're already groaning, this repo therefore has a ton of weird wonky stuff to clobber on-prem stuff together for use with cloud stuff
- you can build an entire career out of helping orgs transition from HAADJ to AADJ üéâ

# docs

- i recently added a docs repo here to store documentation on a wide variety of topics i encounter

- [Jeffrey Snover's blog](https://www.jsnover.com/blog/) - invented Powershell ‚ö†Ô∏è not frequently updated and mostly abandoned but some good old info on here
- [boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev/) - a great place to learn backend engineering concepts and languages, a little on the pricy side but i think its worth it

# future goals

- **learning C# via gamedev**, beefing up my developer skills - Unity, MonoGame, FNA, .NET - I like C# a lot, it directly helps me with future Azure stuff, and I think gamedev is funner to learn with as compared to making like a calculator app or whatever. to clarify, the goal for me here is **learning C#** by using gamedev as the platform to do that, not to learn gamedev specifically. i want to learn C# to help me with my IT career, and gamedev is just a lot funner to me than a lot of other more boring business type apps i could be building with C#. i like building TUI apps too though. basically at this time i don't know what all I can use C# for in Azure but I know it is used in CI/CD pipelines there, and that's what i'm leaning toward. even if i never get there, maybe i can use it to build TUI apps or WPF or Avalonia GUI apps, or whatever. or if nothing else, then at least i'll know more about C# and .NET ü§∑
- **grinding through boot.dev and gaining better "devops" / "backend engineer" skills** - Golang, Python, Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform, Git, etc. - these topics are all DIRECTLY related to my current goals of "doing what i am currently doing, but better". i would really love to move my current organization into this direction as part of our HAADJ to AADJ journey, and these tools and skillsets would take me to the next level of being a more fully professional systems admin.
- **MS Certs?** - maybe, on the one hand i personally don't think certs are valuable for career advancement, and almost no job has ever asked me about a cert -- but on the other hand, they are pretty handy little contained goals to focus on topics for knowledge. i would probably want to get some lower level Azure certs, I have an AZ-900 already the entry level one, but maybe like an MS-102. I'd think my big goal with this if I was going to go after more certs would be to go for the AZ-305.
