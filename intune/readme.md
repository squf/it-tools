# intune tools

i don't have much here at the moment but hopefully i can find and add more useful stuff over time

currently i just have:

**intune-report-cleanup.py** - this script is likely only useful in a shared tenant like i was in, where i would commonly export out reports from intune, and then i would need to filter out just our company prefixes from the other companies sharing the tenant

**webmail-desktop-icon.ps1** - just sets an Edge browser shortcut on user desktops which points to outlook.com for webmail use (we had a lot of F3 license users at one company i worked at, so they just used webmail only)
