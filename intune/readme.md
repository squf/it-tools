# intune tools

i don't have much here at the moment but hopefully i can find and add more useful stuff over time

currently i just have:

**intune-report-cleanup.py** - this script is likely only useful in a shared tenant like i was in, where i would commonly export out reports from intune, and then i would need to filter out just our company prefixes from the other companies sharing the tenant
