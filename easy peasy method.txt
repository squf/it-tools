Personal notes:

- Grab a recent inventory dump off intune, extract the .zip
- Put it in this directory c:\scripts\intune reports
- Rename it to: DevicesWithInventory.csv
- Run scripts
- ???

Notes for other people:

--------------

Retrieve recent device inventory .csv

- Go to Intune
- Go to Devices
- Select "All Devices"
- Select what data you want from the Columns tab, like Serial Number; IMEI, MEID, UserPrincipalName, etc.
- Select "Export" 
- Select "Only include selected columns in the exported file" 
- Wait for download to finish, .zip file will go to your Downloads folder
- Extract .zip to retrieve .csv file, it will be named "DevicesWithInventory..."

--------------

Cleanup the .csv to prep it for the Python scripts

The exported .csv will include all devices in Intune, we want to filter out specific Miller ones. First, move this .csv to the same directory this .txt file is in then rename it to just "DevicesWithInventory.csv" -- remove all the random generated stuff in the name. This is because I can't figure out how to get Python to import a wildcard .csv file name, so, it will look specifically for "DevicesWithInventory.csv".

Run the Python scripts

Field Devices Cleanup.py -- will export a .xlsx file with just the Field devices from Intune
iPads Cleanup.py -- will export a .xlsx file with just the iPad devices from Intune
Office Devices Cleanup.py -- will export a .xlsx file with just the Office devices from Intune
